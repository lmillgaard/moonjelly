# moonjelly

Moonjelly is a group of passionate pioneers within the niches of ocean conservation, philanthropy, storytelling, and blockchain. We are on a quest to innovate ocean restoration, and increase funding, accountability, and community participation in the ocean impact sector.

We are doing this by creating a DAO to decentralise and scale approval of project proposals, verification of impact reporting and development of ecosystem functionalities. We are also developing a governance and tokenomics structure that will allow and incentivise community members to hold governance tokens, vote for proposals and complete ocean quests.
